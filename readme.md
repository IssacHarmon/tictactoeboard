This is my first real project for school. To create a Tic Tac Toe board from scratch. 
Future notes to myself - don't over think stuff. 
Use the inspector tool as much as you can (very powerful).
Ask for help and don't be too proud. 
If you're getting stumped and frustrated - get up and take a break.
